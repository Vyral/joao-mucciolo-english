### Nancy Ulloa

Nancy is a native of San Juan del Sur. She decided to study Tourism Administration to take advantage of the area's primordial business. However, due to fate, she has been working on the business side of things for over 13 years. She has worked in two luxurious hotels: Pelican Eyes and Guacalito de la Isla, which have helped her to make her way into the real estate world which she is passionate about.

This journey in the real estate environment fosters a lot of relationships with extraordinary clients, and achieving their satisfaction is what motivates Nancy the most. Personally, she thinks that there is no place more wonderful than San Juan del Sur to live. Its beaches, its people and the impressive horseshoe bay that everyone falls in love with.

Her motivation for life is her two little daughters of 1 and 4 years who love the sea.
