I was always curious to meet Elaine Miranda from Plata with Platica ([https://plataconplatica.com](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fplataconplatica.com&amp;redir_token=xSoV8d0Th98BKz2gEMXMnQsQ4Gp8MTU4NzkyMjMyMUAxNTg3ODM1OTIx&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=ITtuKf4zofs){: target="_blank"}). The other day I met her at the Entrepreneurs Organization Accelerator Program which I facilitated, and I had the opportunity to ask her to give me this interview. And she said yes\!

Elaine is the most important blogger in Nicaragua regarding personal finance. I thought it would be super interesting if she shared personal and business financial tips, and also her opinion on real estate as an investment vehicle.

I hope you like this short interview.
