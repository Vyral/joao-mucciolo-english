<p style="text-align: center;"><em>From rich breads to tasty pork, here's what the San Juan del Sur farmers market has to offer.</em></p>

Today we’re exploring the farmers market in San Juan del Sur\! Every week, local growers and a few expats come together in one space to sell organic, locally-sourced goods.

**At 1:44** in the video above, watch my interview (in Spanish) with Merlinda, whose fresh breads are a market staple\! We enjoy her coconut bread at home all the time.&nbsp;

**At 3:04** in the video, check out my interview with Mark, who showcases his delicious, slow-cooked pork at the market every Saturday. His hams are brined for a full week, and the pork shoulders are smoked fresh for 24 hours straight.&nbsp;

In addition to selling at the farmer’s market, Mark and his team also cater weddings and parties, including two events at the U.S. embassy in Managua. Merlinda and Mark are just two of the phenomenal vendors whose goods can be tried and purchased weekly at this beloved community outlet.

**The market is held every Saturday from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. in Big Wave Dave’s.&nbsp;**

If you want to hear more of my favorite picks from the market or if you’re interested in buying or selling, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m here to help.&nbsp;
