I met Nadia Vado in a Yoga workshop. What I liked most about the workshop was the things she said while the students did the poses. I clearly remember how good all the things she said made me feel.

Years later, Nadia started a career as a life coach as people asked her to please share the beautiful things she had to say. Over time, she became widely recognized in Nicaragua and the Central American region and now gives seminars for very important companies and organizations throughout the country.

I had the opportunity to ask her some questions in a zoom interview about how we can handle this whole issue of pandemic and stay at home situation.

I hope you like it.
