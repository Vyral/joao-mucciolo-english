<p style="text-align:center;"><em>In light of the holiday season, we want to share what we’re thankful for.</em></p>

Christmas is here, which means now is the time for gratitude. Here at Trinity Real Estate, we’re very grateful.&nbsp;**2019 was a difficult year in Nicaragua, but we have many blessings for which we’re grateful.**

First, we added three great people to our team: Nancy, Gary, and Daphnee. We want to give a special thanks to them for joining us. We’re also grateful for all the families and investors who let us serve them.&nbsp;

On a personal note, I’m grateful for my family. Every time I come home, they’re waiting for me with their arms open, ready to support me.&nbsp;

I’m also grateful we fulfilled our promise of donating 10% of our sales volume to various institutions who need our help. For example, we were able to donate an important sum to San Juan del Sur Day School so they could award scholarships to kids in San Juan del Sur and help them get a better education. We also helped a young professional earn their master’s degree. Additionally, we were able to help the Catholic Church, which is very important to us.&nbsp;

**Lastly, I want to thank you for your support.**&nbsp;If you have any real estate questions or there’s anything my team and I can help you with, don’t hesitate to give us a call. From our family to yours,&nbsp;*Feliz Navidad*\!
