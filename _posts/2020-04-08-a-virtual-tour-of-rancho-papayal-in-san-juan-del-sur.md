Join me on a Virtual Tour of Rancho Papayal in San Juan del Sur. Rivas, Nicaragua

Today I wanted to take you on a Virtual Tour of this beautiful house just 10 minutes from San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua.

This house is located in Rancho El Papayal, steps from Tree Casa Resort. It has 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, a pool, and a beautiful view of the Pacific. We put an aggressive price to sell for just $ 214,500.

At this price, it would be impossible to acquire the land and replicate this same house with its furniture. Therefore, this house is sold below cost.
