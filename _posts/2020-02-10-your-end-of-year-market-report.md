*Today I’m sharing your 2019 market wrap-up and discussing the impact of tourism.*

In 2019, the Trinity Team sold 34 properties, representing 64 total sides (buyers and sellers). For the majority of those transactions, we represented both sides at the same time.&nbsp;

60% of our sales were finished products, whereas 40% were lots. When taking both houses and condos into consideration, the average price per square footage of our sales was $87. Looking separately at houses, the average price per square foot was $88; condos averaged $121.&nbsp;

Why the difference? Well, condos have common areas, walkways, elevators, and parking lots, which all count toward that price per square foot measurement.&nbsp;

Most of our properties were sold fully furnished and turn-key, in pristine (or near pristine) condition. The highest price for houses was $102 per square foot, while the lowest was $70 per square foot. For condos, the highest was $137 per square foot, while the lowest was $102.&nbsp;

The average price per square foot for lots was $3.78. On the high end, it was $11.58; on the lower end, it was $1.17. The highest lot was closest to the water (cliff-front with a phenomenal view), and the lower ones were in remote areas away from the water and with no notable view.&nbsp;

At the end of the year, a lot of people talked about how prices are improving, but I don’t necessarily see it that way. **Tourism in our area did increase from 2018,** so I did note an increase in occupancy rates from our luxury short-term rental company Selva Pacifica.&nbsp;

At the start of 2019, Selva Pacifica saw an occupancy rate of less than 20%. By year’s end, we were seeing that at 60%. It’s worth noting that the market total for Airbnb in the area was only 20% in November and December; perhaps the large gap between Selva Pacifica’s and Airbnb’s occupancy can be explained by the quality of service or the effectiveness of our marketing.&nbsp;

Again, **this improvement in tourism didn’t translate to an improvement in prices.** In my opinion, prices remained constant throughout 2019. In certain areas, like Villas de Palermo, we even saw small spikes in prices, though this is likely because investors bought 10 or so properties very low and prices adjusted later on.&nbsp;

We saw mostly Nicaraguans buying in our market early on in 2019, but as the year progressed, foreigners were made up a larger portion of our buyers.&nbsp;

If you’d like more concrete information, please reach out to me via phone or email. I’d be happy to provide you with a more focused opinion on what happened in our market last year.
