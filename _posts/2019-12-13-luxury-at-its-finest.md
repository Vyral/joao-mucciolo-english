*If you’re looking to buy or rent a luxury home, I know just the place: Malibu in Pacific Marlin.&nbsp;*

Today I’m spotlighting the exclusive Malibu properties in Pacific Marlin in San Juan del Sur. Joining me is the properties’ developer, Lance Rader of Malibu Developments.

Lance relocated to Nicaragua about 10 years ago, and his main business is building social housing in Managua. According to him, the Malibu development originally started as a vacation home for himself. He looked at several different locations along the Pacific Coast before choosing San Juan del Sur to start building.

“I was looking for a place to build a modern home to the standards that I’m used to building and US standards,” he says. “That’s how Malibu came about. I found a fantastic tract of land overlooking the ocean—about 30 stories up—and that’s where Malibu is now.”

**There are three different products inside Malibu:**

* Single-family homes between 3,000 and 4,000 square feet featuring three and four bedrooms with infinity pools overlooking the ocean
* A 3-bedroom/3-bath duplex—also with an infinity pool overlooking the ocean
* 3-bedroom/3-bathroom townhomes about 2,000 square feet with a valley view and community pool

**Malibu also offers a great rental management program** which most of the property owners put their homes through. They have on-site management and staff to take care of the properties, and they advertise heavily for them—their occupancy rate is as high as 80%, depending on the time of year. Every house comes fully furnished with top-of-the-line appliances and every item renters need. Their furniture is of the high-end, contemporary style, and they both build it locally and import it from the US.&nbsp;

What’s Lance’s favorite part of San Juan del Sur? The same reasons he picked this spot to build in the first place: the beaches, weather, and fantastic nightlife.&nbsp;

If you’d like to know more about these properties or you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
