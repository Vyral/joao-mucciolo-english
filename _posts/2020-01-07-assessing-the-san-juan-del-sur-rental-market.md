<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Laura Taylor-Johnson joins me today to share her take on the San Juan del Sur rental market.&nbsp;</em></p>

How’s the rental market in San Juan del Sur? To answer that question, I’ve invited Laura Taylor-Johnson, the head of Selva Pacifica, to join me for today’s video.&nbsp;

Originally from Canada, Laura has been coming down to Nicaragua for 12 years—the last 10 of them to build her thriving luxury rental business. Additionally, she was recently named the top Airbnb host in the country by Airbnb, Inc., and she’s currently working with them to increase the visibility of Nicaragua to potential travelers.&nbsp;

What does Selva Pacifica do? When Laura started collecting homes for rent 10 years ago, she realized there was no dedicated concierge service in the area. That’s how Selva Pacifica was born, and they assist property owners with their rentals. As indicated above, they work specifically with higher-end homes in amazing locations. **Not only do they work with the owners to ensure they get the best guests, but they work with the travelers to ensure they get the best houses.**

On top of that, they handle all the advertising and marketing for their properties, and they have a team dedicated to showing guests the best side of San Juan del Sur. When guests leave, they follow up with them so owners have plenty of five-star reviews to help the exposure and profitability of their investments. They currently have 506 five-star reviews under their belt.&nbsp;

Laura says that the rental market started slowly at the beginning of last year, but after that, we saw a progressive increase in tourists and home rentals. Last quarter, occupancy averaged over 60% in most of Selva Pacifica’s homes. A lot of their homes not only covered their costs, but they made a nice profit heading into 2020.&nbsp;

If you’re thinking about buying a luxury rental (or you already own one that hasn’t been very successful), Laura’s first piece of advice is to **reach out to a professional to help you.** Starting off in a saturated market like San Juan del Sur won’t be easy if you don’t have a professional by your side. If you contact Selva Pacifica, they’ll visit your home and discuss your goals with you.&nbsp;

With so many rental homes in the market, **she also advises differentiating your home.** Every rental in San Juan del Sur has a view; that won’t differentiate you in this market. What *will* differentiate you is the quality of your home. You need to make sure it’s well-maintained and evokes your personal style. If you have a nice house with a view but don’t put any love and care into it, you won’t see a return on your investment.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for Laura, you can email her at [selvapacifica@icloud.com](mailto:selvapacifica@icloud.com). If you’d like to know more about Selva Pacifica, feel free to visit their website selvapacifica.com.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any real estate questions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help you.
