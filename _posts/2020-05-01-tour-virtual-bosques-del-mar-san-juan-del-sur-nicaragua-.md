Have you ever dreamed of owning a lot at the beach? Being able to walk less than 400 meters and being on a beach that seems like you've only seen in magazines? Being able to exercise or walk on trails and forests where the only spectators are the howling monkeys in the area?

Bosques del Mar is a gated condominium, with security, water, electricity, internet ... and with a Club in front of Marsella beach with barbecues, showers, and shade. Jjust 10 minutes driving from the picturesque town of San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua.
