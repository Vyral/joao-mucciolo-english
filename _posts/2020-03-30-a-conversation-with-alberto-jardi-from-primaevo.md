<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Alberto Jardi founded PrimaEvo with the mission of helping people get fresh, organic food delivered directly to their homes. Here are his recommendations for staying as healthy as possible during a global pandemic.</em></p>

Today I’m joined by Alberto Jardi from PrimaEvo. We love his delicious goods, and every time we have a transaction, my clients get a basket of his wonderful organic products. He sat down with me to talk a little bit about his business, the importance of having a healthy diet, and ways to boost your immune system during these crazy times.

Alberto Jardi&nbsp; is also a life coach, personal trainer, yoga instructor, and longevity enthusiast. **He also founded PrimaEvo four years ago as a way to connect those who produce organic food with those who want to consume it.** Small, local entrepreneurs are producing these organic meats, fruits, vegetables, and other products, and PrimaEvo is delivering them to homes all over Nicaragua.

With the pandemic that has been going on, Alberto has offered some suggestions for what you can do to remain calm, relaxed, and healthy during this crisis.

**First, try to reduce your levels of stress through breathing techniques, yoga, or exercise.** Keeping up with the low intensity exercise is very important for your health.

Alberto’s nutritional recommendations include probiotic foods like yogurt and kombucha, fermented vegetables like sauerkraut (PrimaEvo’s includes immune-boosting ginger and turmeric), and dark leafy greens like kale, bok choy, and swiss chard.&nbsp; **A healthy gut biome is very important for your immune system, and these foods will help you create that.**

Thanks so much to Alberto for joining us to talk about the work he’s doing to help keep people healthy through this crisis. If you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
