I know we have many business owners on our client list, so I decided it was a great idea to interview Daniel Marcos, CEO of the Growth Institute ([https://info.growthinstitute.com/home...](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=pInj2V4kDT4&amp;redir_token=9-cHdc-R7WHNrmHMc9hdY3wpF-58MTU4NzU2ODEwMkAxNTg3NDgxNzAy&amp;event=video_description&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Finfo.growthinstitute.com%2Fhomepage){: target="_blank"}), a global business dedicated to learning and coaching company leaders.

Daniel gives us basic tips to stay focused and simplify our thinking during this crisis.
