Beachfront opportunities in the San Juan del Sur area are not that common. For this reason, I am very excited to be able to show you this beachfront option in Paradise Bay, just 5 minutes from town. It is a fairly isolated bay at the moment, with a calm beach as it is well protected from waves by mountains and rocks.

It is a house with 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Access is by dirt road, and the energy of the house is solar. But all of this will soon change when Margarita Ville's entire project is complete.

For more information about this opportunity, please enter here: Beachfront House

If you know of anyone who needs the advice and/or services from us at Trinity, please don't hesitate to connect us.
