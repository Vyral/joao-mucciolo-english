Today, I’m joined by a special guest, Veronica—my wife—to share 10 reasons why we love to live in San Juan del Sur.

{% include pullquote.html %}

My wife, Veronica, and I love living in San Juan del Sur. Here are the top 10 reasons why we do and why you might as well:

1. **Family time.** San Juan del Sur is a small town that’s very inviting for families, and the beach isn’t far away.
2. **Wellness.** If you’re into healthy living, you’ll love San Juan del Sur—there are plenty of opportunities to do yoga, and fresh, healthy fruits and superfoods are readily available.
3. **Surfing.** We are blessed to live near so many great beaches like El Remanso, Hermosa, Yankee, Maderas, and more. There’s great wind and surf almost all year-round.
4. **Schools.** The kids can attend San Juan del Sur Day School, which is a great place for them to be themselves, get in tune with nature, and learn and have fun at the same time.
5. **Beach time.** The beach is pretty much in our backyard. Playa El Majahual is our favorite—there's a lot of room for the kids to play and there aren’t usually many people around.
6. **Meeting new people.** We love meeting new people who travel to San Juan for vacation or who live nearby. They always have a story to tell.
7. **Small town treats.** There’s little to no traffic or stoplights, and there are plenty of delicious foods made by the local people like coconut bread, picos, juices, and other organic treats.
8. **Affordability.** It’s very cheap to live in Nicaragua, and San Juan is even cheaper.
9. **Enjoying the view.** We like to stay home sometimes, and there’s no better place to do that than in an affordable home with a fantastic view.
10. **Immersion in nature.** With the ocean on one side and beautiful trees on the other, San Juan is a great place to soak in the environment. Monkeys and other animals can be seen frequently, and at night, the stars aren’t dimmed by city lights.

As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to enjoy life in San Juan del Sur. If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out. We’d be glad to share any information with you that we can.
