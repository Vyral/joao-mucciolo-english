<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Today I’m interviewing the founder and principal of San Juan del Sur Day School to show you why it’s such a great place to send your children.</em></p>

Today I’m interviewing Julie Spire, the founder and principal of the San Juan del Sur Day School. Why? Because every time I tell someone I moved San Juan del Sur, they ask what I do about schooling for my children. This school has allowed us to live here and know our kids are receiving a great education. If you want additional information about the school, you can visit their website here.
