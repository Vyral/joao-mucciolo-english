*I have another fantastic home in San Juan Del Sur that I'm excited to show you today.*

&nbsp;At the bottom of Pacific Marlin lies a wonderful property I’m excited to give you an exclusive preview of today. It has seven bedrooms, a movie theater, private pool, and it’s just steps away from the bay of San Juan Del Sur\! On top of that, it features a gorgeous view of the bay itself. For $575,000, this home can be yours.&nbsp;**To see a room-by-room walk-through, watch the video above.&nbsp;**

If you’d like to know more about this property or are interested in purchasing, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’d love to speak with you.
