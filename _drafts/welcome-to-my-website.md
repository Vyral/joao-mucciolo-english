Friends and Clients,&nbsp;

As you know, Nicaragua is rife with scenic views, gorgeous beaches, and luxurious properties from which native residents and travelers alike can enjoy all the country has to offer.&nbsp;

**In San Juan del Sur, in particular, there is no shortage of things to do.** Whether you’re looking to surf, lie out on the beach, or take advantage of the city’s more urban activities, San Juan del Sur has something for everyone.

**There’s so much going on in our area, in fact, that I’ve decided to start showcasing these local attractions in the form of a video blog.** I plan to send you between two to three messages each month, each highlighting a different unique aspect of the San Juan del Sur and Tola areas so that you can gain a better understanding of what makes life here so special.&nbsp;

**It has been a pleasure and privilege to have made a career out of helping connect people like you with the experiences living in these areas can offer.** As always, I would be happy to connect you with one of the many fabulous properties available here in Tola or San Juan Del Sur. Whether you’re looking to enjoy a vacation, retire, or explore whatever else the next chapter in your life may hold, I am always here to help you reach your goals.&nbsp;

With all of that said, I hope to hear from you soon. If you have any other questions or would like more information, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to connecting with you soon\!

Your Realtor,&nbsp;
