"From the minute we started the process of buying our second home in Nicaragua with Joao we knew we had made the right decision.  Unlike our first purchase here which was fraught with confusion and anxiety-   Joao’s knowledge of the market, the regulations for foreign buyers, , his incredible communication, patience and availability to us, as well his kind manner put us at ease.   We have full confidence in him as our relator, and we would not hesitate to recommend his services and knowledge for  other serious buyers."

"The truth is that Joao is a different realtor. I feel that he is a well-committed person and is always looking after his clients during the purchase process and after,. He is constantly offering new alternatives in the market. Other qualities that I see in Joao are harmony, fairness, empathy, tolerance, perseverance. In short he is a realtor out of the ordinary. I know I can count on him  100%, either to buy or sell something, I recommend him with my eyes closed. "

"I want to comment that we recently bought a property on one of the beaches in Nicaragua. On this occasion I was recommended to a young man who I personally knew but who I had not made any transactions with yet. Everything that is related to the purchase of property in Nicaragua tends to be complicated, therefore most of the people are suspicious about this. I want to mention that the experience I had doing this transaction exceeded my expectations. Joao proved to be a person that:
 <ul>
<li>Knows the market.</li>
<li>He has vision.</li>
<li>Committed to his customers.</li>
<li>Passionate about what he does.</li>
<li>Extremely dynamic and business promoter.</li>
<li>He is a gentleman of word and very gentle treatment.</li>
<li>Empowered with service and customer satisfaction.</li>
<li>He lives the philosophy of win-win</li>
<li>Seeks to make a relationship and not a transaction.</li>
</ul>
For this and many other reasons, I recommend him"

"The experience of having been advised by Joao for the purchase of property has been very satisfactory because he knows how to interpret the needs of his clients well and knows how to filter and present the offers that meet these requirements. He also advises us well on the way to structure the purchase and sale arrangements: as well as good knowledge of procedures and legal aspects. Personally I had a very good experience working with Joao."
